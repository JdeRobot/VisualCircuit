VisualCircuit is a visual editor for programming robotics applications with blocks and wires.

VisualCircuit is a tool that allows users to program robotic intelligence using a visual language application. It follows a divide and conquer approach where each block is a separate and functional part of the system, running independently at fast iterations. The modular design of this tool allows users to think in terms of blocks running concurrently and easily connect them to each other with wires for communication. This approach helps reduce development time and enables fast prototyping, making it a powerful tool for creating and testing complex robotic systems.
