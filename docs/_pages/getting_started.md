## Goal
The goal of this is to get your first Visual Circuit application up and running. Through the course of this tutorial we will build a simple Colour Filter using our OpenCV Blocks.

### Installation
The installation instructions can be found [here](/install/)

### Starting Visual Circuit
If you are accessing Visual Circuit online then simply open the webpage. 

However, if you are running Visual Circuit locally then:

Start the frontend
```bash
cd frontend/
npm start
```

Start the backend
```bash
cd backend
python3 manage.py runserver
```

### Connecting the Blocks

We will need three blocks for this exercise:
- Camera
- Colour Filter
- Screen

#### Camera

#### Colour Filter

#### Screen
