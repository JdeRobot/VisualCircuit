    ## Filters Colour according to given parameters\n
    The image to be filtered is read through the inputs.
    We can give a Filter between any HSV range by changing the range of the parameters LowerRGB and UpperRGB. 

    `while` loop is the part of the program that is executed continuously.
    It is enabled by default but can be disabled by passing in 0 through the enable wire .

    Here the image is tranformed from `BGR` to `HSV` and then the filter is applied through the `cv2.inRange()`
    function. Finally the filtered image is overlayed on the orignal by the means of the
    `cv2.bitwise_and()` function. This filtered image is then shared through the `share_image()` function.
