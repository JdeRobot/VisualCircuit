    ## Opens your Camera using OpenCV\n
    The Camera block opens your webcam using OpenCV and begins capturing the video feed.
    This video feed is then propagated forward through the `share_image()` function

    `while` loop is the part of the program that is executed continuously.
    It is enabled by default but can be disabled by passing in 0 through the enable wire.
