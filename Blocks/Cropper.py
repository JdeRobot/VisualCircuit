    ## Crops an Image\n
    The image which is to be cropped is read through the inputs using the `inputs.read_image()` function.
    The parameters ask for **x**, **y**, **w**, **h**\n
    ```
    x: x co-ordinate of where the crop should start\n
    y: y co-ordinate of where the crop should start\n
    w: width of the crop\n
    h: height of the crop\n
    ```
    Image is cropped by simple list slicing.\n
    `while` loop is the part of the program that is executed continuously.
    It is enabled by default but can be disabled by passing in 0 through the enable wire.
    Output is shared via `share_image()`
